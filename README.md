# Getting Started with this P2P Lending Application

For the moment it's only run on a development server so those have to be run traditionally through uploading the code to your IDE and initializing both the front end (via React) and the backend (via Node/Express) with 'npm start'. The backend is in its own "environment" if you will so if you run it locally you have to start the server in its own terminal and the react app in another terminal for normal operation.

# General

The premise is that there can be a one stop shop for loans available from peers. This applicaiton would be institution free, and only for registered users to interact with other registered users. Eventually, users would be able to connect and request money from other registered users on the app. They can propose the amount & repayment terms. The lender will then have the option to accept for modify the terms of the loan.

Registered users will also be able to offer ad hoc loans to the marketplace available for any and all to accept. Users can shop for the exact amount and favorable terms that fit their needs and abilities.

# Create a Loan Request

A user is able to connect with other existing users to request loans with specific terms offered.

# Create a Loan Offering

A user is able to connect with other existing users to offer loans with specific terms offered.

# Edit a Request or Offering

Each loan will have an option to edit the terms of the agreement for a set period of time

# Future Development

In the future I would like there to be a "marketplace" for loans. A user could joing and search for an appropriate amount that they are looking to borrow and check terms and conditions set by the person offering the loan.
